# About Me

<img src="https://philipwzf.github.io/profile_pic.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zhaofeng (Philip) Wang (王照峰)**.<br>

I am a Research Assisstant in the [IDEAS Lab](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern Unviersity, supervised by Prof. Qi Zhu. I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Psychology from Northwestern University. During undergrad, I have also had the pleasure of receiving a summer research fund to work with Prof. Zach Wood-Doughty in 2024.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **philipwang2025 [at] u [dot] northwestern [dot] edu**
